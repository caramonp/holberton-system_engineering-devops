<h1>0x06. Regular expression</h1>

<p>A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp;[1] also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.</p>
